abstract = {The game of Mastermind (INVICTA) is played by two persons. It is quite popular and claimed to be quite complex. Recently, we were interested in computerizing this game. This paper summarized the method we discovered and implemented. Our method uses a simple list data structure to represent the knowledge gained. The algorithm was programmed in Pascal on a Burrough B-6800 machine. Some experimental results are presented at the end of the paper.},
